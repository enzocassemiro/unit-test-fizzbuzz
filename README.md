# FizzBuzz TDD Project
This is a simple FizzBuzz implementation, written in Python and developed using Test Driven Development (TDD) with the Pytest testing framework.

## Description
FizzBuzz is a classic programming challenge that involves writing a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, with certain rules:

- For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number
- For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number
- For multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how TDD can be used to create a simple program like FizzBuzz.

## How to run the tests
1. Clone this repository or download the files to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the files are located.
3. Run `pytest test/test_fizzbuzz.py` to execute the tests.

The tests are located in the test_fizzbuzz.py file. This file contains multiple test cases that cover different scenarios of the FizzBuzz problem. The tests are designed to fail initially, and the FizzBuzz code is then developed to make them pass.

## Acknowledgments
This project was inspired in [TDD Manifesto exercices Kata 1 - FizzBuzz](https://tddmanifesto.com/exercises/) that use FizzBuzz as a simple programming challenge to teach beginners about TDD.
